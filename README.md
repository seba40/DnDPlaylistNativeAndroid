<h1 align="center">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p align="center">I started to play DnD a while ago and early on we had a problem with the music that we used for atmosphere . We used  playlists from youtube but it was annoying to skip songs or find other playlists . we tried using other options but in the end i decided to make an app for mobile to make our lives easier . I wanted something with features that we needed and couldn't find anywhere else.
After a month i finished the basics and from now on i will continue to add content, features and bug fixes.  </p>
